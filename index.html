<div id="about-me" class="section-header">About Me</div>
<div class="section-content">I've been independently navigating the Montreal theatre scene since my late teen-hood.  I graduated from the Dawson Professional Theatre Program in 2015, and have since played the role of Brad Majors in Mainline's 2016 production of Richard O'Brien's The Rocky Horror Show, directed by Amy Blackmore; and last winter played Steven in d2 productions' The Shadow Box by Michael Cristofer, directed by Dale Hayes.  From my time at Dawson, I performed as Lysander and Snout from Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, The Mechanic from Will Eno's Middletown, and various roles from Caryl Churchill's Love and Information.  </div>
